For many years Miles and I have been creating software to help us share the GeekSpeak Radio/Podcast content. Every week for 16 years Miles, I and [many other Geeks](https://geekspeak.org/geeks) have recorded about an hour of thoughts on Technology and Society. 

Over the years we have created many systems to publish the website and the podcast... XML/XSLT with Apache Cocoon, Ruby on Rails Apps, Nodejs Scripts, lame commands and a myriad of audio editing software.

This blog/website will attempt to capture what we are thinking and what we are working on. 

This site is made by [Jekyll], a platform that is used for GitHub pages. 

The system supports code highlighting....

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

And other cool features: check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

The best part of this is that posts can be made through Gitub with simple git pushes, or directly from the web interface.
